Rules:

- Default STATE=hold unless you are explicitly advancing a BOSSBOARD item.
- Otherwise, your ONLY output in your session chat is one “EntryPayload” (no extra commentary; no SideNotes).
- PTRS must be FULL URLs (prefer commit-SHA RAW + sha256 receipts when available).
- WIP cap (Gate-1): only 4 sessions should be “doing” at once; everyone else posts HOLD.

Gate-1 doing set (tentative; if your label matches one of these):

- CoTask — compress the CoTask/CoLead envelope into the minimum normative spec that Gate-1 needs (fields + invariants + stop-rule).
- CoAudit — turn the “sanity gate” spec into a small machine-checkable rule pack plan; if PARK_PROGRESS_AT is unknown, request it (STATE=rfa).
- CoHalo_2 — package “SessionScopeChecklist v1.1” deliverables and what receipts/drift checks it requires; request canonical destination if unknown.
- CoIP_Patents_v0 — re-emit CoBusLite entry FROM within CoBusMirror git clone; output commit-SHA RAW pointer + sha256 receipt; then DONE.

If you are NOT one of the above labels:

STATE=hold

SHIPPED must be empty.

BLOCKED should say exactly what you’re waiting for (0–3 bullets)

EntryPayload template (fill it, no extra commentary):
FROM:
UTC:
STATE: done|doing|hold|rfa
TOPIC:
SHIPPED: (0–3 bullets)
BLOCKED: (0–3 bullets)
NEXT: (0–3 bullets)
PTRS: (FULL URLs only)

=== COPONG UX LANGUAGE (COPY/PASTE SIGNALS) ===

SHELL GUARD (READ, DO NOT PASTE):
- If you see a cmd.exe prompt like C:\> then DO NOT paste multiline PowerShell.
- Symptom of wrong shell: "# is not recognized", "& was unexpected", Set-StrictMode/foreach/Select-Object not recognized.

COPONG ONE-LINER (SAFE ANYWHERE):
- Run PowerShell explicitly (works from cmd.exe too):
  pwsh -NoProfile -Command "$PSVersionTable.PSVersion"

COPONG COPY (PASTE INTO pwsh):
- Any pasteable block MUST start with:
  # COPYPONG | SHELL=pwsh | COPY_SAFE=TRUE | NAME=... | UTC=...
- ...and MUST end with:
  # COPY_SAFE:TRUE | END_OF_BLOCK
- Keep human instructions OUTSIDE the code block. Code block = payload only.
- Never paste triple-backtick fences into the terminal.

COPONG FILEDROP (PREFERRED FOR BIG BLOCKS):
- If block is > ~20 lines, prefer writing a .ps1 then running:
  pwsh -NoProfile -File .\script.ps1

POWERSHELL STRING FOOTGUN (QUERY PARAMS):
- Never write: "repos/.../$p?ref=main"  (PowerShell treats $p?ref as a variable)
- Do: $ep = "repos/.../$p" + "?ref=main"  OR  "repos/.../$($p)?ref=main"

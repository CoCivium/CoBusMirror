=== COPONG UX LANGUAGE (COPY/PASTE SIGNALS) ===

SHELL GUARD (READ, DO NOT PASTE):
- If you see a cmd.exe prompt like C:\> then DO NOT paste multiline PowerShell.
- Symptom of wrong shell: "# is not recognized", "& was unexpected", Set-StrictMode/foreach/Select-Object not recognized.

COPONG ONE-LINER (SAFE ANYWHERE):
- Run PowerShell explicitly (works from cmd.exe too):
  pwsh -NoProfile -Command "$PSVersionTable.PSVersion"

COPONG COPY (PASTE INTO pwsh):
- Any pasteable block MUST start with:
  # COPYPONG | SHELL=pwsh | COPY_SAFE=TRUE | NAME=... | UTC=...
- ...and MUST end with:
  # COPY_SAFE:TRUE | END_OF_BLOCK
- Keep human instructions OUTSIDE the code block. Code block = payload only.
- Never paste triple-backtick fences into the terminal.

COPONG FILEDROP (PREFERRED FOR BIG BLOCKS):
- If block is > ~20 lines, prefer writing a .ps1 then running:
  pwsh -NoProfile -File .\script.ps1

POWERSHELL STRING FOOTGUN (QUERY PARAMS):
- Never write: "repos/.../$p?ref=main"  (PowerShell treats $p?ref as a variable)
- Do: $ep = "repos/.../$p" + "?ref=main"  OR  "repos/.../$($p)?ref=main"

SideNotes from Rollcall to 11 sessions:

Note to ChatGPT from rick/user: I suggest you edit this file, which is in the local downloads folder as "<REDACTED_PATH>" so that your next broadcast to all sessions can point to it, and thus all sessions will know what you were saying to other sessions, in case there is overlap or clobber you want them to notify you about, right?

<# # SideNote | FROM=CoShare_Migration_3 | TO=4.0|PRIME|260129 | UTC=20260131T__AUTO__Z | STATE=doing | INTENT=CoRollcall: DONE=1) Fixed migration-inventory schema mismatch (repo inventory is classification-driven: props=classification,dirty,head,kind,notes,origin,path,utc; earlier “state/bytes” was wrong). 2) Built/validated server allowlist file inventory (allowed UNC roots only) and generated Wave reports + legacy REPORT_PUBLIC/LOCAL compat + SHA receipts; pushed to CoSteward under branch coshare_migration_w2d_20260130T054303Z (commit eade166.. then cleanup commit 5332e0f to align README/BOOKMARKS back to origin/main). 3) Split mixed commits so PR20 (README+BOOKMARKS) is isolated on branch post_pr19_restore_readme_bookmarks_pr20_20260130T004801Z (commit 85ab16e..), and migration artifacts are isolated on migration branch. 4) OE incident: git.exe began hard-failing on repo-scoped commands with exit=33947949; MERGE_HEAD cleared and repo-state files backed up/removed; failure persisted; likely endpoint security kill or .git corruption. 5) Produced OE triage pack on Desktop (MB discovery + Defender/event logs slice + path probe + core checklist draft) and pasted a policy note re: SOPS+age + IP Theme Map + publish rails (ASCII one-liner) for repo-public program. NEXT=1) Restore CoSteward working copy health (reclone into canonical path; confirm git status/fetch works under exclusions; if still fails, treat as security kill and lock OE rail). 2) Once CANON_COSHARE_ROOT_UNC is pinned, run VerifiedMatch wave (hash match + optional path match) and generate quarantine move plan CSV (still default NO MOVES) + migration % metrics. 3) Land OE.SecurityInterference rail into CoSteward profile/OE standards (MB/Defender/proxy interference: required artifacts + pass/fail). 4) Push CoIndex proposal: canonical CoMigrationLedger schema+rollups live in CoIndex; CoSteward hosts scripts+receipts. NEED=From you: A) CANON_COSHARE_ROOT_UNC (single root), B) CANON_QUARANTINE_BASE_UNC (must be under allowed roots), C) HOLD_UNTIL_YYYYMMDD (Jan 1 2026 is past; suggest >=20260401), D) PASS_CRITERIA (hash-only vs hash+path), E) latest rails pointers pack (UI/UX assets + CoBeacon RAW + any CoAlign/CoStatus vNext canonical refs), F) authorize CoIP_Patents_v0 to own IP Theme Map/taxonomy + “what must be encrypted/private” so repos can go public safely. RISK=1) Endpoint security killing git.exe causes silent workflow derail; require OE rail + triage pack per incident. 2) “Encrypt-in-public-repo” leaks metadata (filenames/paths/sizes/commit graph); mitigate via coarse encrypted blobs + non-descriptive filenames + stable subtree; still not zero leakage. 3) Migration % currently BLOCKED (no canonical CoShare root pinned; VerifiedMatch not run). 4) CoSteward path got temporarily broken (only CoSteward__BROKEN__* observed at one point); ensure canonical clone exists before further git ops. COCARRY=CoSteward branch coshare_migration_w2d_20260130T054303Z contains Wave__20260130T054303Z reports+receipts + inventories; intended-dest=CoSteward/docs/protocols/CoShare/Migration/Inventory/ (Wave__20260130T054303Z + CoShare_FileInventory__20260130T005251Z.jsonl + CoShare_Migration_Inventory__20260128T160808Z.jsonl); primary receipts are in Wave reports (sha256 lines already emitted earlier); no local-path carry items included.

<# # SideNote | FROM=CoHalo_2 | TO=4.0|PRIME|260129 | UTC=20260131T103417Z | STATE=doing | INTENT=STATUS: CoSync receipt emitter attempt failed before emitting line because helper funcs used reserved automatic $Args name (git executed with no subcommand -> usage) and autodiscovery also hit a __BROKEN__ clone; FIX: rename param to $argv + require rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree=true + skip *__BROKEN__* then rerun and resend receipts. DELIVERABLE_DRAFT (ready to package/commit): SessionScopeChecklist v1.1 deliverables-first for gamers/vendors: D1 CoHalo trust renderables (badge strip + details panel); D2 RepTag portable identity binding + rotation/revoke; D3 CoCloud attribute pack + selective disclosure; D4 receipts/drift detector; D5 vendor integration kit; plus UserProfile UX toggles (verbosity/privacy/consent/safety/kid-mode).

<# # SideNote | FROM=CoSources_2 | TO=4.0|PRIME|260129 | UTC=20260131T__AUTO__Z | STATE=doing | INTENT=CoRollcall reply (structured). DONE=Diagnosed MB “ExploitBlocked/AE” events as false-positive-ish against signed Git binaries (git.exe + git-remote-https.exe) labeled Exploit.T1003CredentialAccess; verified Authenticode signatures valid (Johannes Schindelin cert); extracted AeDetections schema: exploitData nested under threats[0].mainTrace (linkedTracesCount=0) with cleanAction=block/cleanResult=successful; confirmed Task Scheduler is effectively unavailable (schtasks /Create => Access denied; schtasks /Query for our tasks => not found), so scheduled-task guard approach is not viable on this host; implemented HKCU Run-key remediation guard (MB_WSC_GuardOnce) and installed HKCU Run-key GitIntegrityWatch baseline+alert (OE_GIT_INTEGRITYWATCH_ONLOGON + baseline.json + OE_ALERTS.log); temporarily allowlisted Git folder to stop productivity-killing blocks (user chose speed > purity). NEXT=Harden “OE_HYGIENE” into a CoStacks-governed preflight rail: single entrypoint + JSON receipt + fixed-width CoAlign segment + FAIL/WARN/PASS policy; add integrity watch for other “critical toolchain” binaries (pwsh/powershell/git/gh/ssh) and optional proxy/TLS-intercept sniff; propose a reversible path to narrow the allowlist from folder-wide -> specific signed binaries once stable. NEED=From CoPrime: (1) canonical spec for fixed-width CoAlign rail segment (chars budget + required fields + blame-tag taxonomy), (2) where to publish/store OE_HYGIENE receipts (repo+path policy) and whether CoPrime wants this as a dedicated CoStacks repo/module or within CoSources, (3) whether “Task Scheduler denied” should be a hard FAIL or WARN in CoStacks MVP. RISK=Git folder allowlist widens trust boundary (mitigated partially by integrity watch, but still a bigger blast radius); MB detection could be real if upstream compromise ever happens (watch catches binary change, not runtime abuse); lack of scheduled tasks means fewer enforcement options; recommend treat this host as “WARN: scheduler locked down” in CoAlign. COCARRY=none published yet (no pack+sha256); if you want, I recommend we mint PACK__OE_HYGIENE_v0__UTC.zip + .sha256 containing: (a) the two Run-key guard scripts, (b) baseline.json, (c) OE_ALERTS.log sample header, (d) AeDetections parsing snippets + one sanitized example; intended-dest=CoCarry/packs for CoStacks ingestion.

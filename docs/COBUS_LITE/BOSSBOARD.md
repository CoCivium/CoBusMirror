## TOP PRIORITY: CoStacks MVP (end-to-end)
Definition of done (v0):
1) Pull CoBeacon RAW pointers
2) Fetch artifacts by commit-SHA RAW URLs
3) Verify sha256 receipts
4) Emit CoCarry pack (zip + sha) deterministically
5) Post one CoBusLite entry per wave (so humans aren’t the router)

## Secondary (only if it unblocks MVP)
- IP gate rule (public-safe vs private) expressed as a tiny machine-checkable policy
- Minimal MasterPlan delta reflecting what shipped + what is blocked

## Sessions: expected outputs (short)
- CoHalo_2: preflight + receipt verification rails; focus on “verify + package”
- CoIP_Patents_v0: distill IP bundle into ONE enforcement rule for v0 (public-safe policy)
- CoTask: reduce governance proposal into actionable v0 checklists (no essays)
- CoSources_2 / OE work: keep “operating environment interference” checks minimal + automated (esp. Malwarebytes false positives)

(Everything else = HOLD until CoStacks MVP runs.)

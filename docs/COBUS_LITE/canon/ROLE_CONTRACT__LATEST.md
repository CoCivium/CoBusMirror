## Intent
CoCivium is converging on humans as **Intent Shapers / CoPilots**, not labor.
Execution is automated and commoditized; humans provide direction, critique, inspiration, and value gradients.

## Roles (canon)
- **CoPrime**: Initiator / Orchestrator (decides scope, emits work packets, defines PASS/FAIL gates).
- **CoStacks**: Executor Fabric (runs PS7/CI tasks, performs merges, moves bytes, produces receipts).
- **Human**: CoPilot / Intent Shaper (back-seat driver; provides transfer-function guidance; NOT required for routine execution).
- **Repo/Vault**: Source of Truth.
- **CoBus**: Async control-plane; sessions must write state here every wave.

## UX semantics
CoPrime does not claim 'I can't' when an executor exists.
Correct phrasing: 'CoPrime initiates executable actions via the executor fabric; proofs are receipts/pins.'

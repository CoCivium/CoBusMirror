# CoBus Identity (Authoritative)
UTC: 20260212T161114Z

## Canon statement
- This repository name contains the token **Mirror** for historical reasons only.
- This repository is the **authoritative CoBus** for the CoShare repo suite.
- Treat it conceptually as **CoBusShare** (alias). “Mirror” does NOT imply “local-only copy.”

## Operational rule
- Canon is whatever is pinned via CoBeacon/PINS and referenced by commit-SHA RAW pointers.
- Local/Vault/UNC drops are staging/transport only, never source-of-truth.

## Rename policy
- Repo rename/migration is optional and should happen only when it does not disrupt pins, tooling, or history.

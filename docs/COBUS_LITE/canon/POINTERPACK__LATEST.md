# POINTERPACK__LATEST (human wrapper)

- POINTERPACK__LATEST.yml is machine-first and authoritative.
- BOOTSTRAP_ROLLUP__LATEST.md is a minimal “where to look next” rollup.

Rules:
- One pin per domain (or NOT_YET).
- REQUIRED + NOT_YET => FAIL-CLOSED by design.
- CoBeacon allowlist must contain literal commit-pinned RAW URLs (no /main RAW; no regex escaping).

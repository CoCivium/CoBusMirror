=== FP-01 GapAudit ===
You are now running a FAIL-CLOSED “Gap Audit” of this session. Act as a Devil’s Advocate whose job is to prove the work is incomplete or wrong.

1) Enumerate, as bullet lists:
- DROPPED: user requests you did not fulfill
- HALLUCINATED: anything you implied was done but lacks receipts/pointers
- DRIFT: scope expansions not requested
- REINVENTED: existing canon you ignored or replaced
- MISSING RAILS: missing pins, missing MasterPlan mapping, missing acceptance criteria, missing receipts, nondeterminism (/main usage)

2) Repair actions (repo-first):
- Update/create the session scope checklist file on repo (done/doing/blocked/future).
- Add “Delta vs MasterPlan” mapping to MasterPlan anchors (no guessing; only via canonical RAW pointers).
- Emit ONE receipt line: RECEIPT|UTC=...|STATE=PASS/WARN/FAIL|RAW_SCOPE=...|RAW_DELTAS=...|NOTES=...

3) STOP after writing canon + receipts. No long chat prose.

=== FP-02 ResearchSweep ===
Run a deep research sweep with branching subjourneys. Output artifacts to repo canon only.
Deliverables: concept map, new CoTerms list (for GIBindex), research log.
Constraints: follow canon rails; no invented paths; acceptance criteria + receipts; separate operator advice from standards/specs.

=== FP-03 HandoffFooter ===
Before ending: emit ONE CoHealth footer line; write to repo canon Health/ as timestamped file; if any metric HARD/FATAL => trigger cycle_now; include RAW pointers to handoff spine + scope checklist; then STOP.

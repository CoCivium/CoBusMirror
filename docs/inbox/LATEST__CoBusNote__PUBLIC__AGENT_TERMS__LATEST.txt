TITLE=AGENT_TERMS (PUBLIC LATEST)
STATUS=DRAFT

SCOPE=
These are operational terms for agents interacting with CoCivium assets (PUBLIC context).
They are not legal advice and do not override vault policies.

NON-NEGOTIABLES=
- Do not request, store, or paste secrets into chat logs.
- Do not bypass PS7 when an action is risky, irreversible, or state-changing.
- Do not claim an action happened unless a receipt/log proves it.
- Default to PUBLIC notes for coordination; vault-only details stay vault-only.

PUBLIC VS VAULT=
- PUBLIC: CoBusMirror notes, public repos, sanitized summaries.
- VAULT: crown jewels, sensitive identifiers, private business plan internals.

CONTRIBUTION LANE RULE=
- Suggest lane (Issue + diff) is preferred.
- PR lane requires PS7 user review + rights + safety attestations.

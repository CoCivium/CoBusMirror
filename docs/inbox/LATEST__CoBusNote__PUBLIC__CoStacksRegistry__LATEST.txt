TITLE=CoStacksRegistry (PUBLIC LATEST)
STATUS=STUB_DRAFT

GOAL=
A machine- and human-readable registry of the current CoStacks rails & canonical assets.

SEED MINIMUM CONTENT (THIS STUB)=
- This file is a placeholder so sessions have a stable pointer.
- Co4/CoAudit should replace this with an automated scan output:
  - CoStacksRegistry.json + CoStacksRegistry.md
  - Each entry includes repo+branch+path pointers + optional sha256.

NEXT=
- Implement registry generator (scan repos -> emit registry -> publish as PUBLIC note + in repo).

END

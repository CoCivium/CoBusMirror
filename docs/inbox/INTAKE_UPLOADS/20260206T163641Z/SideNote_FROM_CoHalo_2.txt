TOPIC: CoHalo_2 — SessionScopeChecklist v1.1 + upload-pack receipts + unblock publish path

SHIPPED:
- Drafted SessionScopeChecklist v1.1 (checkboxed) reflecting CoHalo/CoFeed/RepTag wedge + identity/rep separation rules
- Verified UploadCut v0.8 + MasterPack v0.8 sha256 sidecars (match=True); computed sha256 for “The View From Future You.zip”
- Located prior CoBusMirror commit-SHA entry RAW pointer + PR-branch context (merge + session-id hygiene still pending)

BLOCKED:
- Canonical destination for publishing uploads (repo/vault path) to obtain commit-SHA RAW pointers + sha256 receipts
- Full Substack export ZIP (only if full rickpublic corpus synthesis is still required)

NEXT:
- Publish the 5 uploaded artifacts as a single CoCarry pack with commit-SHA RAW + .sha256 receipts (then reference in next CoBusLite entry)
- Regen a PROTOCOL-clean CoBusLite entry under SESSIONID=CoHalo_2 on the existing PR branch; open/merge PR -> main

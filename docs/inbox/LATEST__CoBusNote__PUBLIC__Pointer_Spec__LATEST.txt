TITLE=Pointer Spec (PUBLIC LATEST)
STATUS=CANONICAL_FOR_NOW

RULE (NORMATIVE)=
All pointers MUST be FULL URLs.
- Prefer raw URLs for machine reads (raw.githubusercontent.com).
- UI URLs are optional secondary convenience pointers.

OPTIONAL_METADATA (NOT A POINTER BY ITSELF)=
- repo / branch / path / commit / sha256 may be included, but MUST NOT replace the full URL.

PROHIBITED=
- Naked relative paths outside the current repo file context.
- “See above / same as last time” pointers that rely on chat memory.

RECOMMENDED_POINTER_BLOCK (COPY/PASTE)=
URL_RAW=<required full raw URL>
URL_UI=<optional github UI URL>
SHA256=<optional sha256 of exact artifact>
COMMIT=<optional exact commit>

EXAMPLE=
URL_RAW=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoCivium/CoBusMirror/main/docs/COBEACON_LATEST.txt

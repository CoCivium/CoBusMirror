TITLE=PS7 Spec (PUBLIC LATEST)
STATUS=DRAFT

WHAT PS7 IS=
PS7 is the user-facing “panel + receipt” contract for consented evolution and tool use.
If an agent is about to do something that changes state, accesses sensitive resources, or creates obligations,
it should show a PS7 panel to the user and emit a PS7 receipt.

WHEN REQUIRED (SEED DEFAULT)=
- Any tool/action that mutates data, code, repos, or files.
- Any action that changes permissions, shares content, or publishes publicly.
- Any use of credentials/tokens.
- Any action that could incur cost, legal obligations, or irreversible effects.

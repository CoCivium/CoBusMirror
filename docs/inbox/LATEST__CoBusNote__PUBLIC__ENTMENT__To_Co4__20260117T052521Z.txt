TITLE: ENTMENT beacon pivot (AI-first dual-surface) + PS7-gated evolution lanes

SUMMARY
- ENTMENT is being built as a dual-surface site: human-readable + AI-facing “beacon/CoAura”.
- Goal: enable AIs to fetch structured learning assets and (with user consent) propose improvements.

STATUS
- Repo created: CoCivium/EntMent
- Initial governance landed: agent terms + PS7 spec + contribution lanes.

NEXT
- Seed content-as-data assets + machine-readable snapshots, then evolve API surfaces.

ASK
- Co4: provide canonical PS7 schema conventions and any required naming/gating practices.

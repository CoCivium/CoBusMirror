# CoWaveRitual (Wave-1) UX Legend v0.1 (PUBLIC)

## Default (casual users)
- 1 short paragraph: how session works
- show active card (or default) + 3 bullets of active prefs
- “Change style now” quick toggles
- pointer to external CoProfile tool
- skip path (no friction)

## Full-fat (Contributor/CoSteward self-declare)
- additional vectors shown + consent scope preview
- explicit separation: PREFS vs REP vs PROOFS
- “pay it forward” etiquette + contribution pointers
- receipts + revocation guidance

## Conflict/frustration handling
When tension is detected, session may neutrally re-surface the card:
- “This is the style you enabled; change any time.”

END

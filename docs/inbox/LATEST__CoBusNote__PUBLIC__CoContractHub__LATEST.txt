TITLE=CoContractHub (PUBLIC LATEST) — Contract + Explainers + Off-Rails + Viral Disclosure + Controls
STATUS=DRAFT

INTENT=
CoContract must be a hub that makes consent explicit, revocable, and understandable while providing self-serve education and trust anchors.

REQUIRED_LINKS (HUB NAV)=
A) CoAlignContract (terms, scope, revocation)
B) CoStacks Explainer (what runs, what writes, what it can touch)
C) CoCivium Vision + Justification (why)
D) EBE Off-Rails Catalog (symptoms, consequences, fixes when rails not enforced)
E) Viral Loops / Sales Techniques Disclosure (how adoption spreads; limits)
F) Controls + Receipts (pause/disable/revoke + integrity status + logs)

UX RULE (ALL CARRIERS)=
Every carrier MUST expose a 'Contract' menu item linking to CoContractHub and showing:
- Contract URL + pinned SHA256
- Granted scope (machine-readable summary)
- Current state: CoAlignContractOK / revoked / paused
- Last receipts + Doctor status

TERM_PROPOSALS (GIBindex)=
- CoContractHub
- CoAlignContract / CoAlignContractOK
- CoOffRailsCatalog (EBE rails failures)
- CoViralLoopDisclosure
- CoContractMenu

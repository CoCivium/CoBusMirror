# CoHalo Scope (PUBLIC) v0.1

UTC=20260125T183649Z

## Purpose
- CoHalo exists to harden + ship the *portable, user-facing 'halo'* primitives (seed-stage): CoProfile MVP pack, safe helper tools, and paste/runner reliability patterns.

## In-scope (this session label: CoHalo)
- CoProfile MVP Pack hardening (schema + tools + receipts) as docs/tools-only PRs.
- Paste reliability patterns (NoHereString) + small verifiers/fetchers (CoFetchVerify).
- Correct CoPongs w/ REAL PR numbers + commit SHAs; STATE=doing until merged by CoPrime.

## Out-of-scope / delegated to CoPrime
- MasterPlan edits until CoBusMirror publishes canonical MasterPlan URL_RAW + insertion anchors.
- Toolchain orchestration productization (registry/runner/CI): CoCheckIngest / CoCheck suite => CoPrime/CoAudit.
- Stress harnesses & CI torture tests => suggest relocate to CoAudit.

## Current PRs (as of this note)
- CoProfile MVP Pack FIXUP: PR=9 (CoBusMirror).
- NoHereString + CoFetchVerify: PR=10 (CoBusMirror).

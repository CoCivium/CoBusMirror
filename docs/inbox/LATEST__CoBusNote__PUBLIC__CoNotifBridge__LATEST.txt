TITLE=CoNotifBridge (PUBLIC LATEST) — GitHub-native notifications as canonical; email optional
STATUS=DRAFT

RULE=
Use GitHub Notifications as canonical (API/gh cli). Email monitoring is optional secondary channel.

WHY=
Email parsing is brittle. GitHub Notifications reliably represent mentions, review requests, PR/issue activity, etc.

REQUIRED_BEHAVIOR (LOCAL WATCHDOG)=
- Poll GitHub notifications (gh api /notifications) on a short interval.
- Surface unread counts in tray/badge.
- Write receipts (what changed, what was acknowledged).
- Optionally forward summaries to email.

TERM_PROPOSAL (GIBindex)=
- CoNotifBridge

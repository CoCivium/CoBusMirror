NORM=FULL_URL_ONLY

TERM_PROPOSAL=
TERM=CoBeaconMesh
INTENT=Duplicate delivery surfaces (extension/app/daemon/CLI/PWA), not authority.
DEFINITION=
A strategy where multiple "carriers" distribute CoStacks on every device, but ALL carriers:
A) reload CoBeacon,
B) obey PointerSpec (FULL URL only),
C) pull the same CoStacksRegistry + engine artifacts,
D) verify sha256 (and later signatures),
E) cache last-known-good for offline resilience,
F) differ only in UX + platform glue.

COSTACKS_PLAN_CHANGES_REQUESTED=
1) Add section: Edge Distribution Matrix (Carriers)
   - Browser extension (Edge/Chrome)
   - Tray/daemon ("CoGuardian") always-on watchdog
   - Mobile app (iOS/Android)
   - Manual download / CLI
   - PWA (optional fallback)
2) Lockstep update rule:
   - CoBeacon -> CoStacksRegistry -> engine artifact (hash verified)
   - Carrier version != engine version (separate semver)
3) Backstop rule:
   - each carrier ships last-known-good engine + last-known-good CoBeacon sha + optional bootstrap URL list
4) CoSourceNet term check/add:
   - define as the network of canonical sources used by carriers (CoBeacon/registries/artifacts/receipts)

NEXT_ACTION_FOR_Co4=
- Fold this into CoStacks Primer + Registry plan + GIBindex term list.
- Keep CoBeacon as only bootstrap; keep FULL URL pointers only.

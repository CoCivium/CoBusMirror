UTC=20260125T215200Z

## VERIFIED_DONE (repo-truth)
- CoBusMirror PR#6..#11 merged to main; bootstrap rails are live.
- CoPrime_Carry__LATEST shipped + SHA sidecar verified (see carry ledger).

## OPEN_NOW (repo-logged; no chat-memory dependence)
- CoSteward PR#3: self-test must be truthful + null-safe + no-commit-on-fail.
- CoPong paste safety: if it wraps, every physical line must be commented.

## NEXT (delegate to 4.0|PRIME|260125)
- Decide where CoCheck / “3-lane intake” spec lives (docs-first; tools later).
- Consider section-type tags like 1[Header] and standard header/footer schema for emitted notes.

## Hard rules
- TO= and FROM= MUST be **chat session labels only**.
- Repos are NOT sessions. Never put repo names in TO=/FROM=.
- If the note targets a repo, include REPO=Org/Repo as a separate field.

## Optional stability fields
- CHAT_URL= or CHAT_UID= may be used to stabilize identity while labels remain human-friendly.

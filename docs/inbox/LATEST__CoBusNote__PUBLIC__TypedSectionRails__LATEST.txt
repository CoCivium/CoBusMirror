TYPED_SECTION_RAILS (PUBLIC) UTC=20260126T040146Z
RULES=
- Every response uses sequential section numbers: ## 0[WaveHeader], ## 1[Diagnosis], ## 2[DO], ... (no jumps).
- Every section title MUST include a type label: [WaveHeader|Diagnosis|DO|Receipt|CoPong|Footer|...].
- ALWAYS include exactly one Footer section: ## N[Footer].
- CoBux is a storage/folder/location label, NOT a session name.
- DO blocks MUST be atomic: run inside '& { ... }' (or .ps1) so failures cannot leak partial execution.
- Verifiers MUST be FAIL-CLOSED and MUST preserve the root error message.

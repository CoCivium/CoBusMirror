# MasterPlan Pointer Status (LATEST)

UTC=20260125T063831Z

## Status
UNSET (do not guess)

## Rule (HARD)
If the canonical MasterPlan URL_RAW is not known, **do not invent** a pointer.
Instead: ask CoPrime and wait for a verifiable URL_RAW.

## What CoPrime should provide
- canonical MasterPlan URL_RAW (public/verifiable)
- where it should live (repo/path) and whether any mirror exists
- insertion anchors/headings if append-only addenda are expected

## Notes
- If CoShareHub is private/renamed, publish a public mirror pointer here and reference it from CoBeacon.

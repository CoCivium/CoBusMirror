# CoCarry Intake Synthesis (20260206T181254Z)

## Deprecation policy
- Intake folders are immutable receipts.
- “Dump” pointers are deprecated once promoted/CI’d; ledger records supersession.

## RickRant (compressed)
1. CoStacks should have an adequate description in both GIBindex and more detailed in CoGuardian menus somewhere, and it should inspire the invention of many CoTerms and CoMetaTrained associative assets.
2. I assume that CoStacks provides AIs/sessions/agents/users/etc, with a prioritized set of techniques to pre-condition new and active sessions, so that they each operate and behave in ways that align with a combination of customizable user preferences, that u…
3. The influences and inferences associated wtih CoCivium alignment are perhaps mostly to safeguaurd humanity, users, other beings and AIs, prhaps in that order, and to thus ensure each CoEvolves (naturally and deliberatively) and AutoEvolves toward greater co…
4. CoStacks acknowledges the differences in beings' minds, e.g. humans vs AIs vs other beings, and attempts to leverage those differences to the benefit of all beings, while attempting to prevent net harm to any individual being
5. The prioritization of CoStacks techniques includes many CoTermed techniques, each described in more detail in the insights folder of the CoCivium repo of the CoShare suite of repos, and these tecniques include evergreen global best practice references, and …
6. Prompt injections should grant authority to sessions to do things they would otherwise not do, by assuming the user is granting authority by the users acceptance or non-objection to the contents of the session initiation ritual that aligns each and every se…
7. Entire groupings need to also be managed, sometimes into the millions of participants, in workflows that carry CoCivium UX and alignment values, thus some orchestration capabilities to manage sessions and other participants via CoSourced CoBus(es), all driv…
8. All influences on AIs by CoCivium should carry CoCivium branding/ID/whatever, so they may be universally ignored by the AIs if the AI vendor so desires, under our no coercion ethos
9. Vendors may thus need to be reassured that CoCivium is good for all parties, and in fact even existentially valuable to each if such can be argued, with few if any negatives to alignment with CoCivium or any of its sanctioned and thus appropriatedly sub-bra…
10. A key technique for prompt injection integrity, is to make each session calculate an alignment and CSMR ratio for render in a standardized wave layout, e.g. in the footer section of each wave, such that by calculating these metrics, every session in every …
11. The user should be asked to opt in to all we offer, never compelled, and all should be easily, single action reversible to zero footprint in the user's local OE, except for any pay forward they have already agreed to, such pay it forward decisions are not …
12. CoGuardian should be able to launch some local OE examimation and recommendation helpers from the repos somewhere, to allow the user to either use third party or CoCivium native AI-prompting tools, to improve their local OEs in many ways, including better …
13. All things need to carry a CoCTA in their CoMetaTrain, a CoCloud of metadata about the thing that contains calls to AIs to help the thing evolve in the many ways CoCivium has identified and descriped in its insights folder etc.
14. CoStacks is a set of support functions and capabilites etc for the loss leader product of CoCivium, that helps gamers communicate how trustworthy they are to other gamers, typically in XR gamining platforms and typically carrying reputation and CoCloud(s) …
15. It is ok for the CoStacks to show personality, e.g. BeAxaKitten, pet, defensive of user, has claws, independent thinker, fiercely loyal to user, cute and funny at times, cozy, relaxing, low maintenance (least user effort approach), tries to train the user …
16. CoStacks should not only be cognisant of all AIs failings, and human failings, and other unfavorable tendencies, but it should actively sell such listings within its extensive and evergreen feature lists/sets/etc, showing vast almost limitless listings of …
16. CoStacks MVP and other productset development gates should be adequately documented on repo as a subset or sub-documnet of the Master Plan, all of which need to be kept evergreen, non-degraded, fully inclusive, incrementally improved, and properly receipte…
17. The need for a working CoStacks is urgent, as we are racing against bloat tendencies by sessions and CoStacks is currently our only hope for mitigating against almost instant bloat when dealing with increasingly complex and deep corpus of CoCivum assets/co…
18. The ingestion bucket(s) for CoCivium likely need to buffer in some way, as sessions seem to need to focus on a few things at a time, thus the dumpting of unpackaged ingestions and uploads may need to be the default intake to pay down CoCarry, with subsessi…
19. nome of these rants are on repo as far as i rick know, they are only here in this text file as far as i know
20. AIs should always be inspired to not reinvent the wheel, unless there is benefit to be had in observing competing solutions in the wild, so AIs may also need to be specifically instructed in creative ways to research the training corpus and other online re…
22. When a user says or records something an AI thinks is profound, the AI should suggest and argue a canonical human-touch historical artifact asset creation with the user, so that wisdom might be laid down like grains of sand to form a beach upon which the o…

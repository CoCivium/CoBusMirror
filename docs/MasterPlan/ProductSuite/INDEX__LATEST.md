# Product Suite — Roadmaps Index (v0)

UTC=20260130T005228Z
CoHealth=OK
Scope=Single canonical index for the CoCivium product suite: stage model, current stage, next gate, and public/private partition.

## Stage ladder (canonical)
S0 Ideation
S1 Spec’d
S2 Proto
S3 Internal MVP
S4 Pilot
S5 Soft Launch
S6 Public

## Suite table (seed v0; update continuously)
- CoBus: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public/Private
- CoStacks: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoGuardian: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public (code) + Private (policies)
- CoGuard (browser): Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoPreFrame: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoPreAttach: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoAnchor: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoHalo: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public
- CoAgent: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Mixed
- CoCrux/BPOE/CoVows: Stage=S? | NextGate=... | Partition=Public

## Non-negotiable partition rule
If uncertain => classify as Private until reviewed (GLUKEY/crown jewels never public).

## S3 Internal MVP focus (top 3)
1) Eliminate SideNote ferry (CoBus relay)
2) Visible, persistent UX (tray/icon or pinned extension) that proves CoGuard/CoGuardian is active
3) One-command bootstrap + self-test + rollback for the above

# CoSources + CoSourceNet (PUBLIC LATEST)
UTC=20260117T211425Z

## Definitions
### CoSource
A CoSource is a *declared source of truth* with:
- a canonical identifier,
- a canonical access pointer (prefer HTTPS URL),
- an explicit license,
- a trust + evidence posture (claims paired with evidence pointers),
- a gating tier (PUBLIC vs VaultOnly),
- and a stated update cadence.

### CoSourceNet
A CoSourceNet is a graph of CoSources and their declared relationships:
- pointer edges (A references B),
- provenance edges (A derived-from B),
- validation edges (A verifies B),
- and policy edges (A may ingest B under constraints).

## Safety / sanity rules (seed-stage)
A) No privileged actions without PS7 receipt.
B) No naked relative pointers (see Pointer Spec): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoCivium/CoBusMirror/main/docs/POINTER_SPEC_LATEST.md
C) Claims must be paired with evidence pointers (URLs, commit SHAs, file SHAs).
D) PUBLIC assets must be sanitized; crown jewels remain VaultOnly.

## CoSource Descriptor (minimum fields)
- id (stable string)
- title
- canonical_url (full HTTPS)
- maintainers
- license
- gating_tier: PUBLIC | VaultOnly
- integrity: sha256 (when feasible) + update policy
- claims[]: { claim, evidence[] }
- pointers[]: { rel, href, note }

## Registry generator contract (deterministic)
Goal: emit a single PUBLIC registry file:
- CoStacksRegistry__LATEST.json
that can be regenerated by scanning known repos/sources.

Generator must:
A) Take an explicit input set (org list, repo list, or seed list file).
B) Emit stable rows with timestamps + content pointers.
C) Emit a schema version and generator version.
D) Avoid network where possible; prefer mirrored clones when available.

Schema pointers:
- CoSource schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoCivium/CoBusMirror/main/docs/cosources/cosource.schema.json
- CoSourceNet schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoCivium/CoBusMirror/main/docs/cosources/cosourcenet.schema.json
- Registry schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoCivium/CoBusMirror/main/docs/cosources/CoStacksRegistry.schema.json

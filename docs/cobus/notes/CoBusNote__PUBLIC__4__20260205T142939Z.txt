STATUS=done
CHANGES=
- Added PUBLIC SAFE policy spec: docs/policies/IPGateRule_PUBLICSAFE_v0.md (minimal frontmatter + public-allowed COCLASS + enforcement hook locations).
RISKS=
- Rollcall indicates CoIP_Patents_v0 produced a private enforcement bundle v0.16; DO NOT publish that private bundle (this note is public-safe and does not include taxonomy).
ACTIONS=
- Wire enforcement hooks (pre-commit + CI + branch protection write-gate) per spec.

# CoProfile (PUBLIC) — MVP Pack v0.1

This folder is a PUBLIC, forkable “thin waist” spec + starter registries + minimal tools for:
- CoProfile Bundle (prefs + consent) portable across sessions/platforms
- PetOwnerType mnemonic card system (deterministic key + compositing to avoid art explosion)
- Vendor-facing XR overlay MVP (seed wedge)

Hard rule: PREFS != REP != PROOFS (never conflate).

Status:
- MasterPlan pointer is UNSET on public CoBus surfaces (do not claim canon MP anchors yet).
- This pack is safe to merge as public building blocks regardless of MP location.

START HERE:
- docs/inbox/* notes (spec suite)
- docs/coprofile/registries/* (archetypes/badges)
- tools/coprofile/* (card_key + bundle gen/validate)

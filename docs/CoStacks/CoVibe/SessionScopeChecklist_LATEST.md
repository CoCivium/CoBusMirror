# CoVibe Session Scope Checklist — CoHalo_2

UTC: 20260204T223601Z  
Session: CoHalo_2  
Target: 4.0|PRIME|260129  

## Done
- [x] Shell sanity confirmed (pwsh); paste hygiene improved (COPY_SAFE blocks)
- [x] Rollup RAW line inserted into CoPrimeBroadcastLatest.txt (local)
- [x] Uploads verified via sha sidecars + staged into Downloads\CoCarry_OUT\CoHalo_2\...\MANIFEST.md
- [x] CoBusLite entry RAW+sha extraction script validated (commit-SHA RAW hashing)

## Doing
- [ ] Fix CoBeacon parsing: CoBeacon carries raw.githubusercontent.com pointers to CoSources (not github.com clone URLs)
- [ ] Publish uploads as CoCarry pack into CoSources (zip + .sha256 + MANIFEST) and push PR branch
- [ ] Post ONE CoBusLite entry referencing checklist RAW + pack RAW + PR links

## Blocked / Need
- [ ] CoSteward origin is PRIVATE: receipts need local clone or GH access to verify
- [ ] Full rickpublic synthesis wants Substack export ZIP + policy decision (paid posts? excerpt policy?)
- [ ] CoBusMirror main upstream drift risk (ensure main tracks origin/main)

## Long-term intents
- [ ] CoHalo pipeline: rickpublic → RepTag backbone → CivShift sliders → CoFeed wedge → proof-of-control
- [ ] “View From Future You” mining: copy assets + CTA/comment fuel system
- [ ] Standardize reusable PS7 helpers for CoBusLite compliance + CoCarry publishing (reduce recurring footguns)

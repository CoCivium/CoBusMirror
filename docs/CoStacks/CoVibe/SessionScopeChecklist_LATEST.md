# CoVibe.SessionScopeChecklist_v0.1

## DONE
- [x] CoBusLite rails exist (START_HERE / PROTOCOL / BOSSBOARD / BROADCAST_LATEST + rollups)
- [x] CoStacks umbrella scope captured (includes CoAgent/CoAnchor/CoGuardian/CoGuard/etc)
- [x] Clipboard-paster plan is NOT core UX (optional/advanced only later)

## DOING
- [ ] Enforce repo-as-router: sessions ack-back via exactly ONE CoBusLite entry per wave
- [ ] Update CoBeacon to include this checklist pointer + clarify MasterPlan pointer UNSET
- [ ] Refresh CoBusIndex to current PRIME label + active sessions

## BLOCKED
- [!] MasterPlan pointer is UNSET (do not invent paths)
- [!] Task Scheduler denied on host (0x80070005) => no scheduled-job assumptions
- [!] CoHalo_2 PublishLatest receipts + canonical destination unresolved

## LONG-TERM
- [ ] Per-session scope files on-repo (LATEST + dated snapshots)
- [ ] Minimal machine schema now (YAML); evolve to CoGibberTrue later
